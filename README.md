The cleaning worker scheduling problem (CWSP) is to study and analyze the scheduling process in practice and propose models and heuristics to improve both the process and the quality of the resulting schedule.
Workers should benefit from this study by having higher quality schedules while the employees in charge of scheduling should enjoy the positive benefits of an optimization tool to solve problem related to cleaning, 
which should guide their work and is certainly superior to suit and fallacy.
The objective is to maximize the fairness of the schedule. This illustrates how the linear programming solves the cleaning worker scheduling problem and how it has been effectively used in university.
A numerical illustration example of worker scheduling for 8-hour shift is presented and the optimum solution is solved by MATLAB.
